# ta4j-strategies
## Repository to share and discuss trading strategies based on the ta4j-library.
Feel free to contact me if you have any ideas for changes or if you want to be a collaborator.


### Data-Sources:
* Use the Loader class to get some example data
* Update the Loader class if you want to add other (open) data
* For example from:
    * http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/historical-quotes.aspx
    * https://stooq.com/db/h/

### Strategies
* You can define your strategy as a Java class and let it implement the StrategyBuilder interface 
to test and compare it with the StrategyAnalyser



### TODO:
* find format for description files for each strategy
* find a format or way to handle with different kinds of parameters for the strategies
* Implement function in StrategyAnalyser for comparing several strategies (or the same with different parameters..)
